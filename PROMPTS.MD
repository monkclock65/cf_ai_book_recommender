#Creating a page structure: 

using the index.html and styles.css files  inside the frontend folder, create a webpage that has an area for user input in the bottom middle area, and a area for output from an ai that will be structured as follows: 1. picture of book cover, book title and book link 2. book description underneath this 3. room for a list of 10 of these and the ability to scroll down if neccessary to view them. add a sidebar to the page to store past book reccomendations. make it compatible with cloudflare workers and durable objects. 

AI used to: create a basic framework for the
webpage

debug and only change the ai part of the code so that it returns correct output don't change anything else

I have an error in my workflow or index.html of the apiCall being returned to the client as a json object when I want it to be a string. according to the logs, the apicall from the ai is correctly returned

read my current code and fix the aiCall not being sent to the client correctly

what is a secure way for me to store the google books api key without exposing it to github

Create a readme.md based on my current codebase that explains the features of my website. 1. ask about a genre, type of book, or similiar book to get recommendations about that book. 2. the website will display 5 books with images of their titles, an ai description relating to the query, and a link to the google books page with the book. Include explanations of the backend architecture and instructions for local deployment. empathis on using workflows and durable objects to create the architecture
Note: readme edited after ai to fix mistakes and make it more accurate

# adding UI to the website and editing query
what do I do if the ai returns books that don't exist to the google api 

change it to skip unmatched books but add a message to the client that says: Error: ai tried to recommend a book that doesn't exist 

that can't be the whole problem because the if statement where it reads authors is skipped to else statement

change the api query to max 10 items and loop until you find a title that matches the query

can you change the query logic so it prioritizes an image, then the title, and falls back to normal if it can't find one or the other

In index.html, in the submit button event listener, add  a loading animation that replaces the current book card or cards with a message like the one I put

you do not need to change all of that just change the html to add a spinner in the submit event listener. I kept the css changes. do not add a bunch of unneccessary whitespaces. do not delete all of my code and then copy paste it for no reason
